#logical operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
# They are used to perform logical operations on boolean values.
# Example:
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)  # Output: False (both must be True for the result to be True)
# print(a or b)   # Output: True (at least one must be True for the result to be True)
# print(not a)    # Output: False (negates the value of a)
# Example of logical operators in Python
# Logical operators in Python
# are used to combine conditional statements and perform logical operations.
# They are commonly used in control flow statements like if, while, and for loops.
# Example of logical operators in Python
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)  # Output: False (both must be True for the result to be True)
