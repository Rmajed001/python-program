#assignment operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.  
# They can also perform operations and assign the result to the variable.
# Example:
# a = 10
# b = 5
# a += b  # Equivalent to a = a + b
# a -= b  # Equivalent to a = a - b
# a *= b  # Equivalent to a = a * b
# a /= b  # Equivalent to a = a / b
# a %= b  # Equivalent to a = a % b
# a **= b # Equivalent to a = a ** b
# a //= b # Equivalent to a = a // b (floor division)
# a &= b  # Equivalent to a = a & b (bitwise AND)
# a |= b  # Equivalent to a = a | b (bitwise OR)
# a ^= b  # Equivalent to a = a ^ b (bitwise XOR)
# a <<= b # Equivalent to a = a << b (left shift)
# a >>= b # Equivalent to a = a >> b (right shift)
# Example of assignment operators in Python
# a = 10
# b = 5
# a += b  # a = a + b
# print("After a += b, a =", a)  # Output: 15
num=10
num +=10
num1=20
num1 -=8
num2=5
num2 **=2

print("num :",num)
print("num1 :",num1)
print("num2 :",num2)
