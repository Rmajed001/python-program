#logical operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
# They are used to perform logical operations on boolean values.
# Example:
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)  # Output: False (both must be True for the result to be True)
# print(a or b)   # Output: True (at least one must be True for the result to be True)
# print(not a)    # Output: False (negates the value of a)
# Example of logical operators in Python
# Logical operators in Python
# are used to combine conditional statements and perform logical operations.
# They are commonly used in control flow statements like if, while, and for loops.
# Example of logical operators in Python
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)  # Output: False (both must be True for the result to be True)
#In Or operator, if at least one of the operands is True, the result is True.
# In And operator, both operands must be True for the result to be True.# In Not operator, it negates the value of the operand.
a=50
b=30
print(not False)
print(not (a > b),"\n")

val1 = False
val2 = False
print("and operator :",val1 and val2)

print("or operator :",val1 or val2)

print("OR operator :", (a==b) or (a > b))
print("AND operator :", (a==b) and (a > b))
